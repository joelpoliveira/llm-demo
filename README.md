# llm-demo Project

> Personal Project based on stanford course [cs336](https://stanford-cs336.github.io/spring2024/), in which a language model is built from scratch. 

>Instead of making low level code for building the models I gained knowledge regarding the concepts and opted for using pre-built python packages.

- The dataset used is the Tiny Stories, obtainable through hugging face:
```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories/resolve/main/TinyStoriesV2-GPT4-train.txt
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories/resolve/main/TinyStoriesV2-GPT4-valid.txt
